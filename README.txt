Notes:

* Use `./new_post.sh post-title` to create a new blog entry.

* Create a CNAME file in root with the domainname. You can get cheap domain names
from namecheap.

* You can add in google analytics, and disqus comments as well. But you need the
short codes from those services.

* Remove `.bak` from Gemfile and Gemfile.local in ./ to do local dev.
